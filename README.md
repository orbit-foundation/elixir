# Elixir
### A project by PXLTech

#### Elixir is a programming language designed for easy typing.
It is in the idea development phase, you can view our draft of the syntax in the `SYNTAX MATH.md` and `SYNTAX CODE.md` files.

It comes in two forms:
**Elixir Math** is a mathematics-based version.
**Elixir Code** is a professional code version.
